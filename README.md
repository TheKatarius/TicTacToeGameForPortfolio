## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The two players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

To make a move, simply click on an empty cell on the grid. The game will automatically switch to the other player's turn after each move.

If all of the cells on the grid are filled and there is no winner, the game will end in a tie. Furthermore, the game might be reset using the betton in top right corner.
